# Bayesian evidence estimator for radial velocity models

This packages aims to give several tools to estimate the bayesian evidence for different models. It can be used for any model but it's optimized to work with radial velocity datasets and models.

Currently there are two supported nested sampling algorithms: PolyChord (Handley et al. 2015) and UltraNest (Buchner 2021).

For installation download the package and from withing the package folder run:

`python setup.py install`
