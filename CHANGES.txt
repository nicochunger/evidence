Evidence Package Changes Log
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Release 0.1.2: March 27, 2020

  - Improved options for reading datafiles. In the datadict of the configfile
    it is now possible to add a key 'kwargs' with a dictionary conatining all
    keywords necessary for the pandas function read_csv to read the datafile.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Release 0.1.1: March 6, 2020

  - Planet parameters are ordered by period before calculating the likelihood.
    This is to avoid points from jumping between periods and getting multimodal
    posteriors.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Release 0.1.0: March 02, 2020

    - New submodule: rvmodel
        - This submodel provides two classes to be used for the custom models
        - BaseModel and rvmodel
        - BaseModel is a simple class which loads the data and has a log likliehood
          method for simple gaussian error likelihoods.
        - RVModel provides all elements needed for a radial velocities method.
            - Keplerian modeling (true_anomaly impleted in C for better performance)
            - Drift up to order 4 polynomial
            - Linear dependence with parameters (like activity indicators)
    - Added options for reading the datafile like how many rows to skip and
      passing custom column names. More option can be added if needed
    - When running RV models the planet periods are now ordered before calculating
      the log likliehood. This is to avoid parameter jumping (when one parameter
      jumps between different true planet periods instead of staying in the same).
      This will also give cleanear posterior distributions as there will only be
      one peak instead of two or more.
    - It now checks if it's running in the cluster or server and changes the 
      matplotlib drawing environment to be able to make and save plots.

Release 0.0.3: January 31, 2020

    - Post processing Script now runs automatically when PolyChord finishes

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Release 0.0.2: January 24, 2020

    - Fixed Bug where nplanets was not written in filename if there was a comment

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Release 0.0.1: January 4, 2020

    - Initial release, first working implementation of the package.
