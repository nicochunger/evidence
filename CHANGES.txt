Evidence Package Changes Log
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Release 0.2.0: TBA

  - Introduction of a new Nested Sampler: UltraNest (Buchner 2021)
      - All functions remain the same, but one can now choose to run the nested
        sampling with UltraNest. To do this just import the ultranest submodule
        and run with the run() function. Same configfiles can be used than the
        ones from PolyChord.
      - This new sampler also introduces new tuning parameters so these have to
        be indicated in a ultrasettings dictionary thats given to the run function.
        keyword arguments for these tuning parameters are the same as the ultranest
        keywords.
      - post_processing and fip_crtierion scripts have been adapted to work with
        both samplers
  - Introduction of the FIP criterion (Hara et al. 2021)
      - In the parent folder of all the subruns of a particular model it will now
        copy the script to calculate the FIP periodogram with the available runs.
      - This automatically checks for finished runs and uses those.
      - fip_plots now has a function called plot_multiple() which allows to plot
        several FIP plots on top of each other. For example to compare different
        runs of the same model, or to compare different models.
      - FIP periodograms are saved both as pdf's and png's.
      - The FIP script now has an option to turn off the option to display the plots
        after running the code and instead just save the files for the plots.
  - Prior ranges are no longer rounded for display. It could potentially be
    problematic for very small numbers.
  - Linear parameters are now better taken into account in the RVModel. There is
    a new dictionary linpar_dict where the user should add the linear parameters
    and their corresponding timeseries.
  - The time column in RV datasets can now also be 'jdb' instead of only 'rjd'.
  - Changed the ordering planets option. Now it sets redudant solutions (where the
    planets are not ordered) with Likelihood 0. Care should be taken with this 
    option because it can change the value of the evidence and misrepresent the
    models.
  - Tolerance of true anomaly calculation should be able to define it more
    upstream
  - Sorted Priors can now be used for parameters that need to be sorted at the
    prior level. To use this just set the prior for those parameters as either
    'SortedUniform' or 'SortedLogUniform' and the package will handle the prior
    assignation. All parameters that have one of the two sorted priors will be
    considered to be part of the same group. So all parameters with the 'SortedUniform'
    prior will be grouped to have sorted values in the prior. Same for log uniform
    prior.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Release 0.1.5: February 4, 2020
  
  - linear_paramater in RVModel now has an additional keyword 'filter_type' to 
    indicate wether Low pass or High pass filter is desired.
  - Fixed bug where RVModel couldn't be used without adding a jitter.
  - Fixed post_processing to work with new lesta directory layout.
  - Went back to using equally weighted posteriors for the histograms, and bins
    equally spaced in log scale por the periods.
  - Some minor aesthetic changes in the results file.
  - The corner plot is now turned off by default and can be enabled by adding -c
    when calling post_processing.py like 'python post_processing.py -c'. This is
    because it takes a loot of time to process for big models.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Release 0.1.4: June 25, 2020

  - If sesin and secos were used as free parameter, the post processing now checks
    for that and converts them to eccentricity and omega and plots those.
  - Corner plots were added to the post processing
  - There's an option now to choose if the planets should be ordered by period.
    This is added as a key to the rundict in the configfile called 'order_planets'.
    This should be a boolean to indicate if the ordering should happen or not.
    By default, if the key is not added, PolyChord will not order the planets.
  - The post processing now uses the full weighted posterior samples instead of
    the equally weighted posterior samples. This ensures a more reliable posterior
    and it usually has much more points that the equally weighted one.
  - The maxmimum likelihood point has been added to the results file.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Release 0.1.3: April 23, 2020

  - Added Eccentricity values and semi amplitude to the printed results file.
  - Total number of likelihood calculations are now taken directly from the 
    PolyChord output instead of the custom counter.
  - In RVModel the check for a drift in the model is done in the init. This
    means that for models without drift in the default loglikelihood it only
    checks once if there is a model or not instead of doing the whole drift with
    a bunch of zeros.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Release 0.1.2: March 27, 2020

  - Improved options for reading datafiles. In the datadict of the configfile
    it is now possible to add a key 'kwargs' with a dictionary conatining all
    keywords necessary for the pandas function read_csv to read the datafile.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Release 0.1.1: March 6, 2020

  - Planet parameters are ordered by period before calculating the likelihood.
    This is to avoid points from jumping between periods and getting multimodal
    posteriors.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Release 0.1.0: March 02, 2020

    - New submodule: rvmodel
        - This submodel provides two classes to be used for the custom models
        - BaseModel and RVModel
        - BaseModel is a simple class which loads the data and has a log likliehood
          method for simple gaussian error likelihoods.
        - RVModel provides all elements needed for a radial velocities method.
            - Keplerian modeling (true_anomaly impleted in C for better performance)
            - Drift up to order 4 polynomial
            - Linear dependence with parameters (like activity indicators)
    - Added options for reading the datafile like how many rows to skip and
      passing custom column names. More option can be added if needed
    - When running RV models the planet periods are now ordered before calculating
      the log likliehood. This is to avoid parameter jumping (when one parameter
      jumps between different true planet periods instead of staying in the same).
      This will also give cleanear posterior distributions as there will only be
      one peak instead of two or more.
    - It now checks if it's running in the cluster or server and changes the 
      matplotlib drawing environment to be able to make and save plots.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Release 0.0.3: January 31, 2020

    - Post processing Script now runs automatically when PolyChord finishes

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Release 0.0.2: January 24, 2020

    - Fixed Bug where nplanets was not written in filename if there was a comment

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Release 0.0.1: January 4, 2020

    - Initial release, first working implementation of the package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
